    <br>2 POEM FOR A FILM
    <br>-
    <br>I cannot remember her voice - only
    <br>the idea of her voice, what she said
    <br>
    <br>never how she said. I remember what
    <br>I tell myself now
    <br>
    <br>of the things that matter. How her silken
    <br>night gown waved in the wind
    <br>
    <br>as strangers haggled over the things she
    <br>died caring for. I remember
    <br>
    <br>laying awake in Las Vegas, a warm
    <br>desert night - John Denver,
    <br>
    <br>the screen door, & her sweeping the floor
    <br>as I lay, feigning sleep. And she knew
    <br>
    <br>we had been friends then - a team,
    <br>estranged by virtue of something
    <br>
    <br>that had come before my time. I remember
    <br>the way she would sleep outside - I worried
    <br>
    <br>she would freeze to death. Off tune singing,
    <br>binoculars to the stars - & rarely on a clear night.
    <br>
    <br>-
    <br>There is a great satisfaction to be had in yard work
    <br>by night, gardening - pulling weeds by flashlight,
    <br>
    <br>something for herself. Desperation has a respite,
    <br>in fantasy, & sadness by song - by disappearing.
    <br>
    <br>-
    <br>I return home, to a place washed
    <br>in fog. Wet, & blackened - impoverishment
    <br>
    <br>has a way of letting
    <br>the clouds come to ground.
    <br>
    <br>It is because of this place - the smell of rain,
    <br>my ankles damp from morning frost,
    <br>
    <br>how time moves through the valley - I cannot
    <br>help but see how much I have forgotten.
    <br>
    <br>-
    <br>Landscape is an Oregon living room
    <br>filled with afternoon television - heavy breathing,
    <br>
    <br>tiptoeing - sometimes one is so ill,
    <br>they sleep in public.
    <br>
    <br>Every breath, long & shallow,
    <br>all meaning offset by pain: moving targets.
    <br>
    <br>Landscape is the way one watches another
    <br>float awake (still alive), glancing recognition,
    <br>
    <br>reassured someone is still paying attention -
    <br>to witness what is happening, what will happen.
    <br>
    <br>-
    <br>Landscape is how I remember wanting the floor
    <br>to be as comfortable as it was inviting.
    <br>
    <br>Two toned, cleaned, then not clean. There was a special
    <br>way she would skim her foot over the spot
    <br>
    <br>from off white, to white-white. No amount
    <br>of shampoo can remove the smell
    <br>
    <br>of vomit from cheap berber. I remember
    <br>the exact way she vacuumed, straight
    <br>
    <br>then reverse / curved / a little finesse / painting shapes,
    <br>“how the carpet lay” / from one tone, and flipped.
    <br>
    <br>---------------------------------------------------
    <br>*Rodeo walks - toe to heal, and completely vertical.
    <br>I can recognize her from any distance - the farthest
    <br>sometimes my favorite.
    <br>
    <br>The moment before - a threshold between my heart,
    <br>knowing - and my eyes knowing - is a brief
    <br>time of faith and trust in the unremarkable.
    <br>
    <br>To have another, sharing glances, w/ hands
    <br>pressed against - and any other variation
    <br>of loving attention. Nothing is too little.
